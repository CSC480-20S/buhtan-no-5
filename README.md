## Getting Started
Team Engine is building the back end with Python >3.5 and Flask-Restful.

First ensure that all of the required packages are installed.
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
Next ensure that the .env file is located both in the Crpyto Folder and test_server folder. This is essential
for any of the encryption and decryption operations.Refer to the image below.
